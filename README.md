# OnionOrNot
An app where you guess whether an article headline is from r/theonion or r/nottheonion

You start with 3 lives. Life decreases by one each time you get an article wrong.

Data is scraped from r/theonion and r/nottheonion using NodeJS library Cheerio. Then the data is converted to JSON and written to a JSON file as an array. 

JSON file is being hosted on http://myjson.com/

I made this to practice ES6, AJAX, CSS flexbox, and media queries.
